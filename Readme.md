The game i made for my project is Minesweeper, its a game thats been around forever however i have never actually played it.
The goal of the game is to click all of the tiles on the board that do not have a bomb. 
if you click a tile with a bomb you will lose the game. 

Controls:
Left click on any tile to start, you will then see a number appear in that tile. The number indicates how many bombs that tile is touching
I.E. 1=1 bomb 2=2 bombs and so on and so forth. 
Flags are used to mark where you think the bombs are located. 


Bugs:
Player can hit a bomb on the first click and lose the game instantly

Technologies:

JS was the biggest part of this project it was used to generate a random bomb placement feature that will change the position
of bombs every time a new game is started.
